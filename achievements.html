					<div class="ablurb"> <br> In 2015, I competed in the Carson Scholarship Pageant of Excellence — a merit-based competition designed to create a female role model for young girls in my city. I won the pageant, taking the title of Miss Teen Carson and a $1,000 scholarship. As a city representative, my first and foremost goal was to inspire youth with similar backgrounds as mine to overcome their challenges growing up in Carson. </div>
